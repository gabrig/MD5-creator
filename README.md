# MD5-creator
Create your MD5 with or without a random salt: my first project made while learning python
_____________________________________________

# What is it?
It's a symple python script which allows you to create a MD5 hash from a known input.
Could be great to generate a password.

# How it works?
When you start the script, it will ask to enter the string you want to convert to MD5, and it print the converted result.
Then you'll be asked you you want to salt it: if yes, a random number between 0 to 99999999 is choosen to be the salt, and the result is printed.
Finally, you'll be asked if you want to encrypt another string: if yes, the program loop back, otherwise it ends.

# How to run?
1)Run in terminal:
  python MD5.py
  
2)Follow the instructions printed on screen

# Why I did it?
As I'm learning python, I wanted to challenge myself making a program. Here it is.
There are some other version out there, but this is mine.
Hope you guys like it!
